2. Update all variables with your actual values
3. Add environment variables to your deployment platform (Netlify/Vercel)

### 3. Build and Deploy

#### Local Testing
```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run preview
```

#### Deploy via Git
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy to production"
git push origin main
```

#### Manual Deployment
1. Build the application:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. Upload the `dist` directory to your hosting provider

## Multi-Environment Setup

### Staging Environment

1. Create a separate Supabase project for staging
2. Create `.env.staging` with staging-specific variables
3. Deploy using:
   ```bash
   npm run build:staging
   ```

### Development Environment

2. Use `.env.development` for local development
3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Monitoring and Maintenance
