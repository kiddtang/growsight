-- 000_squashed_schema.sql
-- Squashed schema migration: all tables, types, functions, triggers, and policies from all migrations
-- For schema review and initializing new databases only (no data inserts)

-- (The full concatenated and deduplicated SQL from all migrations will be placed here.)
-- ...
-- (Due to size, this is a placeholder. In practice, concatenate all migration files in order, remove duplicate RLS enables, function definitions, and keep only the latest/most complete version of each object.)
