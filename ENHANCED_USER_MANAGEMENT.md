    {/* Enhanced User Manager */}
    {(selectedOrganization || isOrgAdmin) && hasUserManagementPermission && (
      <EnhancedUserManager 
        organizationId={isOrgAdmin ? currentUser?.organizationId || '' : selectedOrganization}
        onUserUpdate={() => {
          // Refresh users after update
          if (isOrgAdmin && currentUser?.organizationId) {
            fetchUsers(currentUser.organizationId);
          } else if (isSuperAdmin && selectedOrganization) {
            fetchUsers(selectedOrganization);
          }
